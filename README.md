Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I showcase two exciting projects that delve into network security and SOC implementation:

1. **Implementation of a Mini SOC with Automated Suspicious Behavior Detection using Atomic Red Team**

In this project, I develop a mini Security Operations Center (SOC) utilizing Wazuh as the SIEM solution. The project simulates various attack techniques using Atomic Red Team on Windows and Ubuntu hosts. The objective is to detect suspicious behavior through automated simulations and log analysis.

2. **Securing a Small Business Network:**


This project focuses on designing and securing the network infrastructure of a small business with 30 employees. The network includes workstations, printers, a server, and guest Wi-Fi, with an emphasis on network segmentation, secure remote access, and protection against cyber threats like malware and unauthorized access.
